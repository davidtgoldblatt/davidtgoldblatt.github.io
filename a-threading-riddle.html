</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The two key primitives used as building blocks for (blocking) concurrent
algorithms are mutexes and condition variables, showing up in C++ as
<code>std::mutex</code> and <code>std::condition_variable</code>.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll describe a pair of functions that can be simply described,
but whose implementation requires a tricky use of these primitives.</p>
<h1>The problem</h1>
<p>Suppose we have an array of <code>N</code> <code>int</code>s. There are two functions we want to
implement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>void modify(size_t index, int value);</code> This changes the element at position
  <code>index</code> to equal <code>value</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>void wait_until_equal(size_t index1, size_t index2);</code> This blocks until the
  elements at positions <code>index1</code> and <code>index2</code> of the array are equal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The question is: how do we implement <code>modify</code> and <code>wait_until_equal</code>?</p>
<h1>The rules</h1>
<p>Without further requirements, the problem is trivial: just have a single lock
guarding the array, together with a single condition variable that all readers
wait on. But this severely limits concurrency: calls to <code>modify</code> that operate on
different indices block one another. It's also wasteful of the waiter time;
every waiter must wake up, acquire the lock, and re-check the values of its
indices on <em>every</em> modification to the array, even if the indices it's
interested in weren't modified. This motivates the first rule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calls to one of the functions should not block waiting on a call to another
  one of the functions unless the two calls have one of their index arguments
  equal.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll relax the problem a little bit, to make it easier, to get a second rule
that deals with races between <code>modify</code> calls.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a call to <code>wait_until_equal(index1, index2)</code> occurs, and the elements at
  indices <code>index1</code> and <code>index2</code> become equal only briefly, it's okay for the
  <code>wait_until_equal</code> call not to return; it can "miss" situations that don't
  exist for long enough.</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't want this rule to be abused though (e.g. with a <code>wait_until_equal</code> call
that never returns), so we'll add one final rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the elements at the indices passed to a <code>wait_until_equal</code> call become and
  remain equal, the <code>wait_until_equal</code> call will eventually return.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we want to make sure we don't waste too much CPU time; we'll have a
no-spinning requirement</p>
<ul>
<li>The internals of <code>wait_until_equal</code> shouldn't busy-wait by spinning until
  their conditions become true. Similarly, loops like
  <code>while (!check_condition())
  { std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(15)) }</code> are cheating.
  The <code>wait_until_equal</code> function shouldn't use CPU time that's not proportional
  to the number of <code>modify</code> operations that are used on its arguments.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are really just to try to prevent "clever" solutions that dodge the
real concurrency issues that are present. I promise that there's a reasonable
solution to this that doesn't involve waiting forever, calling <code>exit(0)</code>, or
other trickery. The only concurrency primitives you need are mutexes and
condition variables, and you don't need an unreasonable number of them (e.g.
having <code>N**2</code> variables is unnecessary).</p>
<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>This problem is pretty abstracted, and the API presented to users is unrealistic
in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's no way to <em>read</em> the values from the array, only to set them and
    compare them for equality</li>
<li>Once you know two values are equal, they won't necessarily remain equal
    after the call to <code>wait_until_equal</code> returns, so you can't rely on their
    equality.</li>
</ul>
<p>But these problems are easy to remedy, once a solution to this simplified
problem is found, and solving only the simplification gets to the heart of the
matter. There are real-world problems that require techniques similar to this
one.</p>
<p>I'll post a solution sometime in the next couple of weeks. I'll keep it in a
separate post to avoid spoiling it for anyone reading this one.</p>
