<p>Seqlocks and reader-writer locks are two techniques used to control access to
shared, read-mostly data in multithreaded programs. Briefly, seqlocks work by
counting modifications to a data structure so that readers can see if a
modification occurred during their read (so that they know their read was
hazardous, and they should retry). Reader-writer locks work by allowing
exclusive access to a data structure to either a single writer, or many readers.</p>
<p>These approaches share a common problem: a writer that stalls (due to a page fault,
descheduling, or a long-running computation, for instance) inside a critical
section can block the readers indefinitely. We'd like to eliminate this
restriction; to allow readers to continue even while a writer is blocked, even
if that writer is blocked inside a critical section. That is to say, readers
should be lock-free with respect to writers. We seek a solution that allows
readers to continue even if a writer is blocked inside a critical section.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, we'll keep two copies of our data structure. The writer
needs to update both copies of the data, one after the other, in order to
logically complete a write. If the writer blocks, it will be blocked inside an
update to only one of the copies. The readers can then proceed by reading from
the other copy, giving us the lock-freedom property we sought.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we'll consider only the case of a single writer thread (there
can be  many reader threads). This limitation can be easily removed by adding an
additional mutex to any data structures we consider, which a writer thread must
acquire before and release after invoking the functions we describe. I've
thought hard about the code here but haven't tested it, so be cautious before
using it.</p>
<h1>Background</h1>
<h2>Reader-writer locks</h2>
<p>Reader-writer locks provide safe access to shared data by changing the control
flow of threads attempting to access the data. When a writer owns the lock, it
owns it uniquely, and readers block if they attempt to access it. Alternatively,
some number of readers may share ownership of the lock; they are then allowed to
read but not modify the data structure, and any writers block while readers are
present.</p>
<p>Reader-writer locks are standardized in C++14 via the <code>std::shared_timed_mutex</code>
class. Below is a class that encapsulates the protected data and the protection
mechanism. Readers and the writer pass in a callback function that performs the
desired operations. For simplicity, we'll ignore things like exception safety.</p>

<h2>Seqlocks</h2>
<p>RW locks often perform poorly in practice. Readers must update lock metadata in
order to indicate their presence to a potential future writer. In typical
implementations, this involves obtaining exclusive write access to the cacheline
containing the lock, which leads to a cache miss for subsequent readers. Even
with fast modern memory systems, cache misses can take longer than a short
critical section, and, what's worse, can be sequentialized in the memory system.
Updates to the lock itself then become a bottleneck. To avoid this, we'd like a
concurrency primitive in which readers can be truly read-only. The seqlock is
one such primitive.</p>
<p>Seqlocks (short for sequence locks, for reasons which will soon become clear)
allow readers to access data concurrently with writers. Since readers proceed
without blocking writers, the readers might see an inconsistent state for the
protected data (imagine a reader that reads half the protected data before the
writer modifies it, then half after). The seqlock provides a mechanism to detect
such a conflict, indicating that the reader should retry.</p>
<p>Associated with a seqlock is a sequence number. The sequence number starts at 0,
and is incremented before and after each write. This implies that at any time
between writes (and therefore, when the data is in a consistent state), the
sequence number is even, since the number of iniitial increments will equal the
number of concluding ones. Readers repeatedly read the sequence number, then the
data structure, then the sequence number again.  If the sequence numbers are
even (indicating that they weren't read during a writer critical section) and
equal (indicating that no writer critical section started and finished in
between the two reads), then the reader can infer that the writer did not
interfere with its read. Otherwise, the reader should retry.</p>
<p>The code below encapsulates some seqlock-protected data. Because reads
and writes may occur on the object simultaneously, we have to represent the
stored data using <code>std::atomic</code> variables; in turn, this requires that we can
treat the protected data as trivially copyable. For simplicity, we won't enforce
this. Similarly, we'll ignore overflow of <code>sequence_number_</code>, use the
default memory order for all operations (giving sequential consistency), and
ignore the inevitable reads from an uninitialized <code>data_</code> array.</p>

<h1>The problem: blocked writers</h1>
<p>Suppose the writer is modifying some of the data protected by a seqlock. It
increments the sequence number, begins writing to the data, but is preempted by
the operating system before it completes. Then, all readers are blocked until
the writer is rescheduled and completes the write. The readers, therefore, are
not lock-free with respect to the writer. An analogous situation can occur using
a reader-writer lock.</p>
<h1>A solution: replicate the data</h1>
<p>The trick we'll use to solve this problem is old, but not widely known. We'll
keep two copies of the data being protected. If a writer is blocked midway
through a write to one copy of the data, the reader can still continue its read
through the other copy.</p>
<p>More specifically, a reader will attempt to complete its read on one copy of the
data. If it succeeds, great; the reader is done. If it fails, it will try to
read from the other copy of the data. This process repeats until a read attempt
succeeds. The writer updates one copy of the data structure, and then the other.</p>
<p>Here is how this technique looks for the reader-writer lock (again, we'll ignore
trivialities like counter overflow and exceptions):</p>

<p>Note: the reader-writer variant we present is not technically lock-free in our
setting; a try_lock_shared call may fail spuriously and return false even if the
lock is available in C++14. This is a technical detail and can be remedied, but
we won't do so here; such a problem showing up in practice is vanishingly
unlikely.</p>
<h1>Decreasing reader failure rates through further replication</h1>
<p>The technique in the previous section is enough to provide a form of
lock-freedom, but readers may still be starved for access if writers continue
much more quickly than them (a writer modifies both copies of a seqlock'd data
instance before a reader is able to read one, for instance). Here, we'll
consider an extension that gives us reduced chances of writer interference, at
the cost of additional copies of a data structure.</p>
<p>The key idea is to increase the amount of replication beyond two copies of a
data object. In order for the writer to block readers, it must update all the
objects before the reader reads any of them. Increasing the amount of
replication increases the likelihood of readers succeeding.</p>
<p>Here's how this looks for the seqlock:</p>

<h1>Some concluding notes on our implementation</h1>
<p>There are a few differences between the replicated seqlock and replicated
reader-writer lock.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The seqlock version updates the entire data structure on every modification.
  The reader-writer one can make small in-place updates. This is a consequence
  of the API we chose for our implementations, so it could potentially be
  eliminated, but this would complicate the writer interface (the readers and
  writers would have to deal with atomic-wrapped data directly, and ask the
  protecting data structure whether its reads were safe).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The converse to this is that the replicated seqlock need only modify one
  version of the data, whereas a replicated reader-writer lock must modify all
  copies of the data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <code>N</code>-replicated reader-writer lock enables another optimization: a thread
  can hash its thread-id or CPU number to get an index to read from:
  <code>thread_id % N</code>. This spreads around the contention on lock-metadata,
  reducing the performance overhead of the lock. In the limit, we have a data
  instance per CPU, and can avoid all non-local writes in the reader path.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, note that we could have used a single sequence counter in the
ReplicatedSeqLock, shared between all data instances. Readers would check it to
see that the range of modified instances does not include the version that it
read from. This results in a modest space savings, at the cost of losing some
simplicity of implementation.</p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>Reader-writer locks were introduced by <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=362813">Courtois et
al.</a>,
and are a well-known synchronization tool.</p>
<p>Seqlocks were popularized by their introduction into the Linux kernel by <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/21379/">Stephen
Hemminger (building on the work of Andrea
Arcangeli)</a>, but were introduced by
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=359878">Leslie Lamport</a>, or arguably even earlier, in the
work of <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806505">William B. Easton</a>. This fact
is not widely known.</p>
<p>The idea of using multiple copies of a data structure to improve the blocking 
properties of readers goes back to
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=357198">Peterson</a>,
who introduced a mechanism which is wait-free for the writer as well as readers.
These ideas were explored most fully by <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.50.5034">Chen and
Burns</a>.
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1455262">Larsson et al.</a> provide a
comprehensive survey.
<a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=128736">Lamport</a> uses a clever variant of
a similar idea as well.</p>
<p>The specific cases of replicating
data for reader-writer locks and seqlocks is a well-known trick, but I can't
find a cite for the first use. It is used, for instance, in <a href="http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/kernel/time/timekeeping.c?v=3.17#L231">the Linux
kernel</a>,
and explored by <a href="http://concurrencyfreaks.blogspot.com/2013/11/double-instance-locking.html">Ramalhete and
Correia</a>
in what they call "double-instance locking".</p>
<p>Using <em>more</em> than two copies of a data structure to improve reader seqlock throughput when
writers are common is a trick from <a href="http://www.1024cores.net/home/lock-free-algorithms/reader-writer-problem/improved-lock-free-seqlock">Dmitry Vyukov</a>.</p>
